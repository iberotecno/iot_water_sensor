Telegram water sensor for ESP32.

This example sends a telegram message from te ESP32 board to a cell phone with Telegram App installed when a water leakage is detected by the sensor. Youn only need to copy the lib content to your arduino libraryes folder and run the program that you find at src folder.

You will need to install Arduino IDE: https://iberotecno.com/blog-supratecno/47-tutoriales-paso-a-paso/107-como-instalar-y-configurar-el-ide-de-arduino-tutorial
